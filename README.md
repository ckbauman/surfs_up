- The min. temp between June and December shows a little cooler overnight temps in Dec of 56 vs. 64 in June
- The max. temp between June and December is also very similar with 83 (dec) and 85 (june)




## Summary

Oahu has very moderate and consistent temperatures throughout the year.  Primary weather changes are more noticible in the dry vs. rainy seasons.  These conditions are also different depending on what side of the island you are on.

Better weather information could be found by running additional queries.

- Avg. rainfall totals for the month of June and December - Oaho totals
- Avg. rainfall totals per station for the months of June and December.
